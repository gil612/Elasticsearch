I have no idea. But she's got a great record.\" Kluft, American Joyner-Kersee and Russia's Larisa Nikitina are the only woman to have broken the 7000 points barrier. Meanwhile, last year's world indoor champion is determined to add gold at the European Indoor Championships to her collection, with the meeting held in Madrid in March. \"It's a good experience to compete outside of Sweden and outside of Europe,\" said Kluft. \"It's going to be a great competition here in Boston, a great preparation for the European Indoors Championships.\""]}
