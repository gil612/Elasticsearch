The 31-year-old Scot was suspended for two years in 1998 after testing positive for nandrolone. \"I had intended to race but I'm running like a goon,\" said Walker. He told the Herald newspaper: \"I'm not in great shape, after missing about a month of training. \"I missed a big chunk of speed work over about three weeks, and then another week working in America. \"If I'd had a half-decent mark it might have motivated me more, but I won't be racing. \"I still enjoy training, but feel it's time to move on, and concentrate on a career.\""]}
