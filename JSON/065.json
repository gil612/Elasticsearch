Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\""]}
