And the Commonwealth and European silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence. \"It's the stress,\" said Johnson. \"I am not used to feeling this, this early. I am just used to training. \"But if I'm doing this kind of thing, then I will have to see how it goes.\" Johnson next competes in the high-class Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February."]}
